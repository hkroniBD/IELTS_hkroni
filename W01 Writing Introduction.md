# **Lecture on Academic IELTS Writing Tasks**

## **1. Introduction to Academic IELTS Writing**

The Academic IELTS(International English Language Testing System) Writing test is designed to evaluate a candidate’s ability to communicate factual and discursive ideas in written academic English. It consists of two tasks to be completed within **60 minutes**.

✅ **Task 1** — Descriptive report on visual data (minimum 150 words)
✅ **Task 2** — Discursive essay on a topic of general interest (minimum 250 words)

**Weighting**: Task 2 carries more weight (about two-thirds of the total writing score), so candidates should allocate approximately 40 minutes to Task 2 and 20 minutes to Task 1.
