### **Exercise 1: Line Graph**

**Question:**
The line graph below shows the percentage of people aged 65 and over in three countries (Japan, Sweden, USA) from 1940 to 2040. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

**Model Answer:**

The line graph illustrates the proportion of individuals aged 65 and above in Japan, Sweden, and the USA between 1940 and 2040.

Overall, the percentage of elderly people has increased in all three countries and is expected to continue rising, with Japan projected to experience the most significant growth after 2030.

In 1940, the USA had the highest proportion of people aged 65 and over, at around 9%, followed by Sweden at about 7% and Japan at approximately 5%. Over the following decades, the proportion in the USA and Sweden increased steadily, reaching around 15% in 2000. In contrast, Japan remained relatively stable, with a minor decline until around 1990.

However, after 2000, Japan’s elderly population began to rise sharply and is projected to overtake both Sweden and the USA by around 2030, reaching nearly 27% in 2040. Sweden will follow closely behind with approximately 25%, while the USA is predicted to have a slightly lower figure of about 23% by 2040.

### **Exercise 2: Pie Chart**

**Question:**
The pie charts below show the proportion of electricity generated from different sources in Germany and France in 2009. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

**Model Answer:**

The pie charts compare how electricity was produced in Germany and France in 2009 from various sources.

Overall, France relied heavily on nuclear power, whereas Germany depended more on conventional thermal power.

In Germany, conventional thermal sources accounted for the largest share, producing 59% of the electricity. Renewable energy contributed 17%, while nuclear power generated 23%. Other sources made up only 1%.

Conversely, in France, nuclear energy dominated electricity production, contributing a significant 76%. Conventional thermal power played a much smaller role at only 10%, while renewable sources provided 13% and other sources 1%.

These figures demonstrate that Germany used a broader mix of sources but leaned towards fossil fuels, while France was much more reliant on nuclear generation.

### **Exercise 3: Process Diagram**

**Question:**
The diagram below shows how instant noodles are manufactured. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

**Model Answer:**

The diagram illustrates the various stages involved in the production of instant noodles.

Overall, the process involves mixing raw materials, shaping, cooking, drying, packaging, and finally labeling and dispatching the finished product.

First, flour, water, and oil are combined in a mixer to form dough. This dough is then rolled into sheets and cut into strips. The resulting noodles are steamed and subsequently dried with hot air to remove moisture. After drying, they are formed into blocks. These blocks are then packaged into cups along with vegetables and spices. Finally, the cups are labeled and sealed, ready for shipment to retailers.

### **Exercise 1: Opinion Essay**

**Question:**
Some people believe that governments should focus more on public health rather than on other forms of public spending such as education or infrastructure. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

**Model Answer:**

It is often argued that public health deserves greater priority than education or infrastructure when allocating government funds. I partly agree with this view because public health is essential for a productive society, but education and infrastructure are also crucial for long-term development.

On the one hand, investing in public health helps ensure that citizens are healthy, which improves workforce productivity and reduces the burden on national healthcare systems. For example, vaccination programs and disease prevention campaigns can save significant public funds in the long run.

On the other hand, education is vital for equipping people with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed, while infrastructure supports economic growth by enabling trade and movement. Ignoring these areas could harm the country’s competitiveness and prosperity.

In conclusion, although public health should receive substantial funding, it should not overshadow other vital sectors such as education and infrastructure. A balanced approach is necessary for sustainable progress.

### **Exercise 2: Discussion Essay**

**Question:**
Some people think that the best way to increase road safety is to increase the minimum legal age for drivers. Others believe there are more effective ways to improve road safety. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

**Model Answer:**

There is debate over whether raising the minimum driving age is the most effective way to make roads safer or whether other measures would be better. In this essay, I will discuss both views before stating my opinion.

Supporters of a higher legal driving age argue that younger drivers lack the maturity and experience needed to handle dangerous situations on the road. Statistics often show that accidents are more common among teenagers and young adults. Raising the minimum age could therefore reduce these incidents.

However, others believe that stricter testing, improved driver education, and better enforcement of traffic laws could be more effective. For instance, new technology like automatic braking systems and speed limiters can also play a significant role in reducing accidents regardless of age.

In my view, while age is a factor, a broader set of measures is more effective. Focusing only on age ignores other crucial elements such as skills, behavior, and vehicle safety features.

### **Exercise 3: Problem/Solution Essay**

**Question:**
Many cities are experiencing serious traffic congestion. What are the main problems associated with this, and what solutions can you suggest?

**Model Answer:**

Urban traffic congestion is a growing concern in many cities around the world. This essay will examine its main problems and propose possible solutions.

One major problem is increased air pollution caused by idling vehicles, which contributes to climate change and respiratory diseases. Another issue is the economic loss due to wasted time, as people spend hours in traffic instead of working productively.

To address these problems, governments could invest in efficient public transport systems to encourage people to leave their cars at home. Additionally, introducing congestion charges in city centers, as done in London, can reduce vehicle numbers and promote greener modes of travel like cycling and walking.

In conclusion, traffic congestion is harmful to both health and the economy, but public transport improvements and congestion pricing can help mitigate its impacts.
