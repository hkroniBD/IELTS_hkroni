---

## **4. Key Challenges in Academic Reading**

⚠ Complex academic vocabulary
⚠ Long, information-dense paragraphs

**Important Note**: There is **no extra time** to transfer answers to the answer sheet — students must write answers directly.

---

## **5. Strategies for High Scores**

### **5.1 Skimming and Scanning**

✅ **Skimming**: Read rapidly to get the *gist* of the passage (e.g., first lines of paragraphs, headings, topic sentences).

✅ **Scanning**: Search quickly for specific words or numbers, e.g., names, dates, percentages.

✅ Combining both is essential for managing time.

---

### **5.2 Understanding Question Types**

* **True/False/Not Given**: Carefully distinguish between *contradiction* (False) and *no information* (Not Given).
* **Matching headings**: Look for the main theme of each paragraph, not just repeated words.
* **Summary completion**: Identify synonyms; the text rarely repeats words exactly as in the question.
* **Multiple choice**: Read all options and eliminate clearly wrong ones.

---

### **5.3 Dealing with Academic Vocabulary**

✅ Use context clues to guess unknown words
✅ Pay attention to prefixes/suffixes (e.g., *bio-*, *-ology*)
✅ Focus on *meaning*, not translating word-for-word

---

### **5.4 Time Management Strategy**

* Allocate about **20 minutes per passage**
* Avoid getting stuck on difficult questions
* Move on if needed, then return later
* Always write an answer — there is no penalty for wrong answers

---

## **6. Reading Skills Development**

Encourage students to:

✅ Read widely from academic texts
✅ Practise identifying argument structure (claims, evidence, examples)
✅ Note how topic sentences control paragraph meaning
✅ Develop a personal list of high-level academic synonyms
✅ Take regular practice tests under timed conditions

---

## **7. Sample Practice Exercise**

**Passage snippet:**

> *The global decline of bee populations is causing significant concern among environmental scientists. Bees play a critical role in pollinating plants, including many of the world’s food crops. Various factors such as pesticide use, climate change, and habitat loss are contributing to their decline.*

**Sample Questions:**

1. Bees are essential because they help pollinate crops.

   * True / False / Not Given
   * *(Answer: True)*

2. The global bee population is increasing due to climate change.

   * True / False / Not Given
   * *(Answer: False)*

## **8. Common Mistakes to Avoid**

⚠ Reading too slowly and missing the overall meaning
⚠ Searching for exact words instead of synonyms
⚠ Failing to check spelling (incorrect spelling = wrong answer)
⚠ Writing more words than allowed (especially in gap-fills)
⚠ Ignoring instructions (e.g., “NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS”)

---

## **9. Practical Advice**

✅ Always read instructions carefully
✅ Highlight keywords in both question and text
✅ Be systematic: answer easier questions first
✅ Practise under strict timing at least once a week
✅ Transfer answers carefully and check for spelling errors

✅ Make a list of 20 new academic words from your practice reading, with definitions and example sentences.

---

## **11. Conclusion**

In summary, the Academic IELTS Reading test measures your ability to process complex academic language under time pressure. With a combination of skimming, scanning, effective vocabulary strategies, and consistent practice, a Band 7 or higher is entirely achievable.
